## JavaScript Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types
Learn about `var`, `let`, and `const`, and understand primitive and reference types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

### Operators
Explore arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators with practical code examples.

### Control Flow
Master conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `for...of`, `for...in`) to control program logic effectively.

### Functions
Understand function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and the concept of scope and closures.

### Objects and Arrays
Learn to create, access, and manipulate objects and arrays using modern methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

## Advanced Concepts

### Asynchronous JavaScript
Understand callbacks, promises, and async/await for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

### Modern JavaScript Features (ES6+)
Explore ES6+ features such as template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, modules, and classes.
